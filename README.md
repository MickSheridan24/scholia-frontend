## Scholia

##### _Built with ReactJS and Redux_

**Purpose:** With _Scholia_, users can access complete texts from _The Gutenberg Project_. They may see other users' annotations, and provide their own. In short, with _Scholia_, everyone gets the same marked up copy of any classic text!

**Usage:**

1. **Sign-up and Log-in**

2. **Find and checkout your text using the "Search" function**

All texts supplied by _The Gutenberg Project_. This database includes most open copyright texts, such as classical novels from th 18th and 19th Century. For example, Searching _Moby Dick_ would serve up Herman Melville's classic whaling adventure! Unfortunately, due to copyright issues, _Scholia_ can't provide copyrighted texts. 
  
3. **View Annotations using the Annotation Navbar**

See your own annotations and filter other annotations by categories. Change whether you'd like to see only the annotations in your current view, or all for the document. Jump to annotations in the text, like them if you thought they were good, or delete your own. 

4. **Add New Annotations by Double-Clicking in the text**

The Annotation will be added at the end of the word you double-clicked.
